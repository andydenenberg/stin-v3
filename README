Bug fix:  Fixed the Activities range selection.  '==' is valid in sqlite3, but failed in Heroku PG.

<Begin:>
Imrovement request:  New Activity preselects the worker field with 'Andy' ( first record in db ).  Should change behavior to preselect with current_user.

Improvement request: Should be able to click on the current category menu bar item ( organizations, activities, etc. ) to go to top level.  Currently clicking on the item does nothing.

Improvement request: Move the Add New green button to the top of each of the category index displays.

Improvement request:  Clean-up the blue and green buttons on each record create and edit to be consistent across categories.  Some blues are labeled send, submit, etc.

improvement request:  Dry up the code so the menus and navigations controls are in application.html and not in each of the individual page files.

improvement request:  fix the code so the config.yml statement can be consistent between local and heroku in the user and org model files.
